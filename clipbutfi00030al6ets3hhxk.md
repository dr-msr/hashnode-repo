Oh well guess what, less than 12h after I had the idea of mySurau, one local developer announced his project of "ratemysurau", a project almost similar to what I had in mind.

Granted, when I scrolled through his GitHub, it was incepted around 4 months ago.

Although looks quite similar, upon trying and viewing his app, i think i had a different picture and idea in my mind. A different technology too. Maybe we're visualizing a similar end product but then I guess that is all we are hoping for - to push for a MVP (minimum viable product) in return for some public support and seeding the database.

This hasn't hampered my interest and effort though. I am looking through at this project through the lens of learning. So i think I'm gonna look at his project and see it's development. Perhaps it'll become a hit in the country, which in that case, is good for the ummah.

One thing that motivates or drives me doing programming is so that I can use what I develop, personally. That's why sometimes i feel like i put too much expectation or standard in getting things done "according to my way".

Perhaps I'm still too young or budding in this programming arena. There's still a lot of me that needs maturing and thinking in a more realistic way, alongside my skills. Idea comes and go, what may seems like "ordinary" could end up being a hit few years later. Especially in the IT, changing ever so rapidly and fast!
