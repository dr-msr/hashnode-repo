Back then when I had my first programming exposure in 2001, I was 13 years old. I've always an affinity towards programming. The school, they allocate me a desktop PC specifically so that I could work on my project and enter the inter-school science fair competition.

I guess their investment paid off when my team and I, as the lead developer, we emerged as champion for the national level. I was selected to represent my country in the INTEL ISEF in the States, but I didn't go due to some things that happened.

Throughout the years, I've spent a fair amount of time fiddling in programming, particularly web programming. I'd subscribed web hosts, play around with different types of PHP CMS later on, Joomla and Wordpress.

Even though during high school i majored in science and subsequently entered medical school, my interest and affinity towards programming and coding never wavered away. Every once in a while I would undertake projects such as setting up the student's club site, local community portal site, alumni database. I also spent a good amount of time tinkering my own site. It was all so fulfilling and exciting despite none of them persists until today. Well even a giant like Friendster and Myspace also perished.

My only regret now was that I've never got it all documented. I have stories, experience but nothing to show and tell. At that time despite i did blogging, it was primarily about my own life and study as a medical student. I never thought anyone would be interested or benefits from my technical writing particularly in programming/coding. Especially since I've never had a proper education or certification, i assume my knowledge, despite my interest and passion, was still sub-par compared to most of IT/tech blogger out there.

I forgot that the only audience I should be concerned about my writing is, myself. By documenting my progress and journey, I can identify my strengths and weaknesses. It can serve as a milestone tracker for my IT knowledge too.

This year I am planning to devote a portion of my time and life into coding/programming. I am setting up few things, and I thought this developer blog would serve as a good beginning to document my journey. I will try to sort it systematically and update it frequently but then I hope I can be consistent in doing it. After all, it's those small persistent things that contribute to excellence in the long run.
