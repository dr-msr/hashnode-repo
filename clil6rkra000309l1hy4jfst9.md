I think it's been about a month since my last blog post, mainly because I've been tired. I don't know if others feel this way too. When I face a problem, I need to spend time learning and finding the best solution. But while doing all the reading, searching, and watching tutorials, I got really tired and felt like "I can't take it anymore."

So, I would take a break for a while, and then when something interesting came up, I would feel excited to learn something new and figure out new things again.

So, concerning the Hub project, I managed to create an attractive (at least to me) login page, using magic.link as the authentication provider. However, upon reviewing my code, I realized that the way I had hardcoded all those APIs was never secure to begin with. I researched modern full-stack development methods, current and up-to-date standards, and understood that I needed to utilize one of the established, standardized frameworks.

Previously, I discussed Remix.run and found myself drawn to its design. The structure seemed logical and made sense to me. The fact that it offered full front-end and back-end support made me feel like I didn't have to rely on anything else. However, I struggled to find a starting point for learning how to use it. That's why I realized I should have familiarized myself more with JavaScript, Node.js, and React. As for database support, I feel comfortable with Firebase suites, and I'm glad that Remix can integrate well with it (I assume). When it comes to styling and templating, Remix relies on Tailwind, which is quite new to me. I'm still stuck on CSS and currently struggling to understand SCSS.

One step at a time, i guess.

I want to connect more with others who think like me. I discovered many of them on Twitter. I saw a tweet about someone who made a Chrome extension using ChatGPT, even without much coding experience. It feels like a challenge for me. I know ChatGPT, but I get annoyed with the delays and occasional lost replies. I wish I could share my thoughts on this. I want to blog, but I thought Hashnode only works with web apps! I like the easy use of Hugo and GitHub Pages.

I know I'm not proficient in Git. That's why I need to use Git more, as it's the only way I can improve my skills. I installed Hugo, discovered a fantastic theme, and set up a new landing page.

I decided that, since I want to become more active in the community, I should establish a digital presence. Having a website is a start; I'm not looking to impress, but I want to express my interests and share my milestones.

Then, I discovered that Hashnode actually has its own Android app that supports native updating. Oh, okay, that's nice.

However, I don't like the design. It feels so bulky, almost posh, you know, kind of like a luxurious, buffed-up car. I want something simple and appealing, which could complement my Hugo site's theme. That's when I found out that I can actually customize Hashnode using custom CSS! Now, this is a game-changer. So, I spent the night tweaking my Hashnode profile to match my landing page. It's too bad Hashnode doesn't come with a landing page feature in the first place, or else I wouldn't have had to rely on GitHub and Hugo. But is that really a drawback?

Another thing that I feel important (and something new too), is about the AI assistant that is provided by Hashnode. Wow, it made my writing so seamless. I can literally write without having to worry about spelling or syntax because the AI will fix it for me, rephrase my sentences, and actually made it better for reading.

Now I can fulfill my intention/wish, to write freely without worrying whether my reader can understand it, because AI will be helping me in that process.

Well, let's see how it goes. I will be updating about my progress on The Hub and other concurrent projects soon. Thanks for reading!
