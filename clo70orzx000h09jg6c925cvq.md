So, what happened since last update? Well a lot happpened actually.

First, the biggest update in my life was that I enrolled and accepted into the #42, the programming school. I completed the dreadful Piscine selection, which comprises of 24/7 full time coding experience for the whole month. Out of 84 candidates that started the Piscine with me, only 30 manage to complete it, and I'm grateful that I am one of them.

42 is a private, non-profit, and tuition-free computer programming school that offers a unique and rigorous coding education emphasizing project-based learning, collaboration, and creativity. During the Piscine, we learnt the basic of Shell scripting and C language. I manage to pass the Piscine at level 9, and posted my codes to my Github.

Now that I'm in the program, our first project was libft. Libft is our own library of useful functions in C language, which can be reused in our future projects. The codes for my libft is published on my Github.

Now that I'm working on my next project, I may choose from three different projects:

* born2beroot : basically a project about virtualization and setting up a linux machine via command line / shell.
    
* ft\_printf : to recode the popular printf function.
    
* get\_next\_line : learn to open and read file and buffering the file content.
    

To be honest I feel like all those three projects are related. Each of them represent a different level of functionality, from macro (virtualization and setting up machines) to micro (manipulating the data/memory block and printing it out).

My blackhole date (the dateline in which a project should be completed) is not until next year, hence I think I want to do all those three projects within this year.

### Portfolio

Now that I have something on my Github to put as a showcase, I think I want to update my website. Currently I'm using Hugo hosted on my Github Pages. I've done some editing but it was a bit reckless (i dont know a thing about Go), hence I've botched the codes, I guess.

I want something that is flexible and scalable. I also want my website to be fast. I want to integrate it with this blog, too. Currently this blog is being served directly from Hashnode (with CSS customization so it matches my website), but i want to play with the data directly. I also want to it be pushed to my personal website too, as an archive.

I was contemplating on the database type. I want something that can handle content posted from any devices. I rarely work with images/photo. I dont need advance formatting too. I'm still getting used with markdown.

Coincidentally, i read that today Hashnode launches their version of headless CMS! Which mean I can now continue blogging on Hashnode. Their app is quite decent, although personally I feel a bit cluttered with the feed function (i only need the editor). But at least it still work on my phone effortlessly. Or i can just use any mobile device and simply navigate to hh.new to start writing.

If anything, with their API, i can just develop my own frontend for posting content later to suit my pickiness.

As for the framework of choice, i guess the best way to go now is Next.js., and I've been wanting to try the shadcn UI. Let's see how it is going to be!
