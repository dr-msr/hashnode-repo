title: "Authenticating The Hub"
---

Sekejap je, Kid.

I think it is very difficult for me to connect. Of showing weaknesses/vulnerabilities, because other people might not perceive the same way. It is difficult for me to step on the grass, try to find my footling and place where I belong. 

Ah, doesnt matter. Things are temporary anyway. Dunia je, sekejap je Kid. Just do the best that you can. You don't need to connect to anyone for that matter. Stop showing your vulnerabilities, you are fine on your own, without having to trust anyone but God. People, they saw you for who you are. But once they got a glance of the monster behind the mask, I can guarantee, people will stay away from you. 

Which is why, I am counting my days on this life as a doctor. Who am I kidding, I don't belong here. I can't connect even on a human level to anyone, let alone my patients. They deserve better. Sekejap je, Kid. You are doing the best you can to explore this alternative career path. Interacting with computer, via means of codes, scripts, its the best. Its predictable. Its 0 and 1. Its boolean, true and false. Either it is working, or its not. Simple. You don't have to deal with all those feelings, expectations, disappointments, arguments. Worse to worst, you can just destroy, scrape everything, and start rebuilding from scratch.

I want to live minimally like this. Minimal humane and social interaction. I've already off the hook from all those social media. I dont think I can handle any more external stimulations. I can manage, live like a hermit. Sekejap je, Kid. Somehow you are already 35, thats normally half of normal optimistic human life expectancy. But you know you already got your health concerns. So your remaining life maybe even shorter than that. Add to the fact that your BPD is (somehow) not really stable, so who knows, tak lama dah. 

Let us just be mindful and focus on the current day. You are enjoying your life, focusing on self-care and things that really makes you feel whole. That is enough for you. Yeah, you do feel lonely often not. You yearn for that connection, that sense of belonging. But guess what : you dont need it pun, not in the afterlife. Instead, tambah jadi dosa ada lah. So tak apa, Allah akan cukupkan engkau. Kat syurga nanti inshaAllah Dia akan ganti dan tambah segalanya. Sekejap je lagi, Kid.

Somehow aku rasa bersyukur that I dont put my long-term commitment anywhere, in terms of my career/cari makan. Maybe, next year, aku kena seek out new opportunities. Aku tak boleh lama-lama kat klinik ni lagi dah, bila lama sangat ko tengok ini lah yang jadinya. Engkau tak cari pasal pun, orang lain yang cari pasal dengan engkau. So lebih baik engkau start planning your exit strategy.

Jangan risau, percaya saja kat Allah yang Dia ada perancangan yang lebih baik. Allah Maha Kuasa. Dia Maha Penyayang. Dia takkan biar engkau (dan orang sekeliling engkau), kebuluran. Dia tahu, sebab Dia yang letak engkau kat jalan ini. Dia ada timeline Dia sendiri untuk engkau.

Lift up your head. Ride through this feeling, this moment. Sekejap je, Kid.
