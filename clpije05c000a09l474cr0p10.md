So last week, I participated in a game jam organized by 42KL. The game jam was open to students at the Cadet level, registered in teams of 3 or 4 members.

It was my first time joining a game jam. Back in the old days, I used to dabble with RPGMaker, but I never took it seriously nor did I have a finished "product."

When the Bocals of 42KL announced the GameJam event earlier this month, I was excited. I knew I was just a beginner and didn't think I could contribute much. Additionally, with me still working most days, that's not ideal for a game jam. Usually, a 55-hour game jam like this is akin to a marathon event â€“ 55 hours of non-stop coding.

Nevertheless, I managed to find like-minded team members - Awang, Hershel, and Danial. We all agreed that we were participating for the sake of exposure and experience while still trying to come up with a product. But they understood my limitations.

The platforms of choice for the game engine were GDevelop and Godot. I was completely new to both of them. I asked on ChatGPT and found out that Godot has a much steeper learning curve, compared to GDevelop, which is more beginner-friendly and straightforward.

The theme was announced only on the day the GameJam began last Friday. The theme was "Lost."

Prior to the theme announcement, I had already dabbled with 42's internal API. I found out that the intranet of 42 provides API access to its students for free, which one can use to access public data of the campus, other students, and more. So during the discussion, I suggested the idea of making a game "by 42, for 42" concept, which integrates information retrieved from this API.

We decided to create a top-down platform game, in which the theme "Lost" is incorporated as a plot to the game itself. The game mechanics were thought to be pretty standard, but with references to the 42 Program, such as Piscine, leveling, and curriculum. The bocals would be included as boss NPC characters inside the game.

As far as the integration with the API, the data from the API (e.g., the student's level, experience points, evaluation points) would serve as modifiers to various game parameters (e.g., difficulty settings, plot narration, NPC profiles). Hence, it would have high replayability value. There could also be certain hidden quests or plots that could only be unlocked if the student themselves completed specific projects or reached certain levels.

Of course, ideas were easier said than done. Throughout the two days, I was able to initiate the API and get through the authentication and basic data retrieval. My colleagues worked on game assets, the game mechanics themselves, and pushed through the whole process of submissions.

When the judging commenced on Monday (yesterday), we didn't have a finished product. Instead, we had a proof of concept and ideas. Well, most of the other teams did too. To be fair, for some of us, this was the first time we entered a game jam or tried GDevelop or Godot. Even experienced game developers would feel the pressure in a 55-hour long GameJam.

But I guess that's the whole purpose, especially in the 42 School of Programming. Exposure first; the details and content would come later.

I'm glad I was able to join the game jam despite not being able to give full commitment.

One thing I learned from the event was that developing a game is very difficult. It's definitely not a one-person job. You need different people handling programming, assets, and plots. Each of these requires a specific skill set or talent. And to make a really great game, each of those skill sets needs to be top-notch on their own.

Who knows, one day I'll venture into that path. Keeping an open mind, I will!
