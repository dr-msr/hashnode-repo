mySurau : a directory of local surau in Malaysia.

Introduction

Surau is a prayer room/establishment that is smaller than masjid (mosque), typically located at a commuting/public places to cater for a quick prayer.

Problem Statement

As someone who travels and commutes a lot, i find that looking for a surau is always a gambling or a game of chance. I would never know whether the surau is complete with it's amenities, let alone comfortable. Often when I spent my time in a shopping mall, i have to Google to find out where the surau is located in that particular mall.

In Malaysia we typically have surau in almost all petrol station. But of course, one could be more comfortable than the others.

Looking for the direction is one thing, and then there's the issue of parking. Since muslims typically stop at a surau for just a brief prayer (no longer than 15mins), a surau that is next to a parking space is a convenience. And there's the issue of "waiting time" too. I wonder if I can create a mechanism that is able to track the busyness of a surau particularly during peak hours time (major prayer times five times in a day).
